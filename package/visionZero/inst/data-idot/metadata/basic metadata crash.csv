1,ICN ,Text ," Illinois Case Number (ICN) is a unique identifier assigned to each crash by the Crash Information System (CIS).  It is used to link records between the Crash, Vehicle, and Person levels.  At the Crash level, the ICN will appear one time for each crash.  At the Vehicle and Person levels, the ICN may appear multiple times depending on the number of vehicles and persons involved with the crash.  ICN’s for years prior to 2010 may be eight or 12 characters, while ICN’s for years 2010 and later are 12 characters.  For ICN’s with eight characters, the first character represents the year of the crash.  For ICN’s with 12 characters, the first four characters represent the year of the crash."
