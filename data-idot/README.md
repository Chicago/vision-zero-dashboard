# Important conditions for data use

You are only allowed to use this data in conjunction with the hackathon. You may not host, publish, or distribute the data for other purposes. 

Additionally, the Bureau of Data Collection requires the following statement be placed on any work product that incorporates or references our data.

**DISCLAIMER: The motor vehicle crash data referenced herein was provided by the Illinois Department of Transportation.** Any conclusions drawn from analysis of the aforementioned data are the sole responsibility of the data recipient(s).  Additionally, for coding years 2015 to present, the Bureau of Data Collection uses the exact latitude/longitude supplied by the investigating law enforcement agency to locate crashes. Therefore, location data may vary in previous years since data prior to 2015 was physically located by bureau personnel.

# Metadata CSV files

The csv files regarding basic metadata were developed based on the IDOT metadata, but are not created by IDOT.

# Differences between IDOT crash data and eCrash data

Reporting Requirements to IDOT: 

The legal reporting threshold for traffic crashes involving only property damage is $1,500 when all drivers are insured. However, if any driver does not have insurance, the threshold remains $500. In both cases, the investigating enforcement agency must complete and forward a written report to IDOT, on a form provided/approved by IDOT, within 10 days of the crash investigation. Private property crashes are not excluded from this requirement.

# Tips

Crash data has changed over the years, and especially big changes happened in 2013.  Whenever performing analysis on this data please consider looking at each year separately, and pay special attention to the metadata documents. 

The SR 1050 form is what's used to complete crash reports. The [Illinois 2019 manual](http://www.idot.illinois.gov/Assets/uploads/files/Transportation-System/Manuals-Guides-&-Handbooks/Safety/Illinois%20Traffic%20Crash%20Report%20SR%201050%20Instruction%20Manual%202019.pdf) is 40 pages, and comes complete with a cutout that officers can overlay with the form to assist when completing the form. 

For reference: the national [2013 instructions](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/il_crash_report_instruction_manual_2013.pdf) and [2009 documentation](https://www.nhtsa.gov/nhtsa/stateCatalog/states/il/docs/SR1050.pdf).
